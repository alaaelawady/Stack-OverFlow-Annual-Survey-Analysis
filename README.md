Problem Description
===================

    Our client is an educational IT organization. They reached out to us with the following:
    “IT jobs and technologies continue to develop rapidly. This makes our field one of the most interesting. But on the other hand, this rapid development is confusing our students. They do not know what skills they need to learn any job.” “Do I need to learn C++ to become a data scientist?” “Do sysadmins and DevOps use the same technologies?” “I really like JavaScript; Can I use it in data analytics? These are some of the questions our students ask. Can you develop a data-driven solution for our students to answer such questions? They mostly want to understand the relationships between functions and technologies.
